Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability to show your understanding of the learning outcomes. Please provide examples from your project code to support your answers. Only links to your own git will count. When you explain what you did make sure to explain why you did it this way with clear reasoning relating to your own work and not generic statements that anyone could make.

## Evaluation Material


### Algorithms

Algorithms are manyfold and Java can be used to program these. Examples are sorting or search strategies but also mathematical calculations. Please refer to **two** areas in either your regular coding practice or within your project, where you have coded an algorithm. Do not make reference to code written for other classes, like theoretical informatics.


*your text*

My project uses algorithms to parse mathematical expressions and calculate results, besides that I also have worked on some Algorithms which I learned in my self study sessions, I'll link them both.

### Data types

Please explain the concept of data types and provide examples of different data types in Java.
Typical data types in java are int, double, float, char, boolean, long, short, byte, String, and arrays. Please provide one example for each of the **three** following data types in your code. One of these links must be to your project.
* Array
* Strings
* boolean

Regarding the link to your project, explain the context in which you have used this data type being specific to your project.

*your text*

I use various data types like double for numerical calculations, String for handling text input, and LinkedList for storing past operations, ensuring that data is handled appropriately and efficiently throughout the application.  
Also in my self study sessions I have worked on various data types, I'll link the folderArray where I have done multiple operations on array furthermore I would say all codes have data types in it.

### Complex Data Structures

Examples of complex data structures in Java are ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, LinkedList, and TreeMap. Please provide an example of how you have used **two** of these complex data structures in your code and explain why you have chosen these data structures. Examples do not have to come from the project.

*your text*

I use LinkedList to manage a dynamic list of memory entries, allowing for operations like adding, removing, or recalling previous calculations in my project.
And I have practiced with multiple types of data structures, such as ArrayList, Tree, LinkedList, Queue, Deque  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/a4ca67d79937e79326dad329da2c9de7918ce53e/src/main/java/org/calc/ScientificCalculator.java

### Concepts of OOP
Concepts of OOP are the basic building blocks of object-oriented programming, such as classes, objects, methods, and attributes.
Explain HOW and WHY your **project** demonstrates the use of OOP by using all of the following concepts:
* Classes/Objects
* Methods
* Attributes
  Link to the code in your project that demonstrates what you have explained above.

*your text*

In my project I used OOP concepts by creating classes like ScientificCalculator and MemoryStorage to encapsulate functionalities and manage the GUI and memory operations, Methods within the classes like executeOperation and add, and attributes like the field text area in the ScientificCalculator and the memory in MemoryStorage.  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/a4ca67d79937e79326dad329da2c9de7918ce53e/src/main/java/org/calc/ScientificCalculator.java

### OO Design
Please showcase **two** areas **where** you have used object orientation in your project. (How and why you use it will be the next question below.)
Examples in Java of good oo design are composition, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

*your text*

In my project the main calculator GUI inherits from JFrame, it uses pre-built methods and properties from Java's Swing library for managing window features.
Polymorphism is used in event handling where actions are performed depending on the button pressed, all under a single interface method.
I have MemoryStorage class to manage all operations related to memory storage. This class encapsulates the memory-related functionalities like adding a new result to memory, fetching the last saved result, and clearing the memory.
Abstraction is not used directly in my project, but I've practiced in my learning sessions.  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/a4ca67d79937e79326dad329da2c9de7918ce53e/src/main/java/org/calc/ScientificCalculator.java  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/367618519b95478c02afbcc5842d5a26988d9de5/OOP/Abstraction.java  
here I have worked with an abstract class Shape which has abstract methods

### Advanced Class Concepts
Advanced class concepts include constructors, abstract classes, interfaces, access modifiers, static methods, and variables. Please provide an example of how you have used **two** of these class concepts in your **project** code and explain why you have chosen these class concepts and how they work within your code.

*your text*

In the project the ScientificCalculator class has a constructor that initializes the user interface of the calculator.
In the MemoryStorage class, I used private access modifiers for the LinkedList<Double> memory attribute to restrict access to this list directly from outside the class.
The use of abstract methods and classes can be just shown from my learning sessions.  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/a4ca67d79937e79326dad329da2c9de7918ce53e/src/main/java/org/calc/ScientificCalculator.java   My project  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/367618519b95478c02afbcc5842d5a26988d9de5/OOP/staticMember.java   here I have static member playerCount which is used by all the objects of the class  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/367618519b95478c02afbcc5842d5a26988d9de5/OOP/Abstraction.java   here i have used abstract methods area() and toString();

### Testing
Java code is tested by using JUnit. Please explain how you have used JUnit in your project and provide a link to the code where you have used JUnit. Links do not have to refer to your project and can refer to your practice code. If you tested without JUnit, please explain how you tested your code.
Be detailed about what you are testing and how you argue for your test cases.
Test cases usually cover the following areas:
* boundary cases
* normal cases
* error cases / catching exceptions


*your text*

In the project I tested boundary cases by entering the maximum and minimum double values (Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.MIN_VALUE)
I tested error cases by entering invalid inputs,like not numbers. I also have done exceptionhandling in the project, like NumberFormatException thrown by executeOperation
beside that I have handled the topic Exception handling in my learning sessions  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/367618519b95478c02afbcc5842d5a26988d9de5/Advance/ExceptDemo.java   here I perform multiple arithmetic operations and throwing ArithmeticException :)

### Operator/Method Overloading
An example of operator overloading is the "+" operator that can be used to add two numbers or concatenate two strings. An example of method overloading is having two methods with the same name but different parameters. Please provide an example of how you have used operator or method overloading in your code and explain why you have chosen this method of coding.
The link does not have to be to your project and can be to your practice code.

*your text*

I have done constructor overloading :)  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/367618519b95478c02afbcc5842d5a26988d9de5/OOP/twoConstructors.java  
and here the code of method overloading where The Sum class has three overloaded versions of the sum method.  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/367618519b95478c02afbcc5842d5a26988d9de5/OOP/Sum.java  besides that i have practiced method overriding as well  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/367618519b95478c02afbcc5842d5a26988d9de5/OOP/methodOverride.java  each class has the toString() method by calling super.toString()

### Generics
Generics in java are used to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on objects of specified types. Please provide an example of how you have used generics in your code and explain why you have chosen to use generics. The link does not have to be to your project and can be to your practice code.


*your text*

In my Project Generics are used in the MemoryStorage class, to be used with any data type, though currently used for storing Double values.  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/a4ca67d79937e79326dad329da2c9de7918ce53e/src/main/java/org/calc/ScientificCalculator.java   my Project

here I have declared a type parameter generic, it just tells the compiler that this method can have any data type, so it should be ready for it.  
public static <T> int count(T[] array, T item) this would allow me to count string elements too.

### Class Libraries
Examples of class libraries in java are the Java Standard Library, JavaFX, Apache Commons, JUnit, Log4j, Jackson, Guava, Joda-Time, Hibernate, Spring, Maven, and many more. Please provide an example of how you have used a class library in your **project** code and explain why you have chosen to use this class library.

*your text*

My project uses Java's Swing library for the GUI and integrates the exp4j library for mathematical operations, it shows how external libraries can be used to extend the functionality of a program  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/a4ca67d79937e79326dad329da2c9de7918ce53e/src/main/java/org/calc/ScientificCalculator.java

### Multi-threading
multi-threading is the ability of a CPU to execute multiple processes or threads concurrently. Please explain the concept of multi-threading and provide an example of how you have used multi-threading in your code. The link does not have to be to your project and can be to your practice code.


*your text*  
My project uses Multithreading to perform calculations in the background, preventing the GUI from becoming slow.  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/a4ca67d79937e79326dad329da2c9de7918ce53e/src/main/java/org/calc/ScientificCalculator.java  
and i have practiced this also in my sessions  
https://github.com/hossei-cyber/Java-Self-Study/blob/367618519b95478c02afbcc5842d5a26988d9de5/Advance/Multithread.java  
here the MultithreadingDemo class extends the Thread class, it creates instances of MultithreadingDemo to work as separate threads.  
In the main method, eight separate threads, are created and started.

### Lambda Expressions
An example of a lambda expression is the following code:
```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.forEach((String s) -> System.out.println(s));
```
Please explain the concept of lambda expressions and provide an example of how you have used lambda expressions in your code. The link does not have to be to your project and can be to your practice code.
